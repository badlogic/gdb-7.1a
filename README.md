## GDB 7.1a for DJGPP
This is a fork of GDB 7.1a, one of the last known "good" versions of GDB that can still load coff-go32 executables as generated by DJGPP.

This fork produces an executable specifically for the `i586-pc-msdosdjgpp` target needed to debug DJGPP applications.

The fork is supposed to compile with the latest MinGW on Windows, GCC on Linux, and Clang shipping with Xcode on macOS.

## Building

### macOS
Install `autoconf` via brew, `Xcode` from the app store. Then:

```
./configure --target=i586-pc-msdosdjgpp --disable-werror
make -j8
```

The `gdb` executable can then be found in the `gdb/` folder.

### Windows
Get `Msys`/`MinGW64` and ensure you have `autoconf` and `gcc` installed. Then:

```
./configure --target=i586-pc-msdosdjgpp --disable-werror
make -j8
```
